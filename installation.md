## Installation

### Install on hosting

:::tip
If you're a Laravel developer, and you want to customize our source code in `platform/core` and `platform/packages`,
you need to delete folder `vendor` then run command `composer install` to reinstall PHP dependencies.
:::

JobBox is based on Botble CMS, checkout the video for the installation.

- Upload all files into the root folder of your hosting (normally, it's `public_html`).

- Create a database and import data from `database.sql` (it's located in source code).

- Update your database credentials and `APP_URL` in `.env`.

- Go to `/admin` to access to admin panel.
- The default admin account is `admin` - `12345678`.

### Config to work on sub-folder

Itâ€™s based on Laravel framework, the root folder for it is `/public` so if you install it in a sub-folder,
you need to access `your-domain.com/sub-folder/public`. To remove `/public`, check below video.

### Setup cron job

Cronjob is used to send emails abandoned carts notification automatically every week. You can ignore this step if you
don't need that feature.

```shell
* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```
